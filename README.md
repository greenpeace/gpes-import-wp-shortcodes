# Shortcodes to import frontend code

Shortcodes to:

* Import a text file that was uploaded to the media library.
* Import an external URL (development only, please)

Normally used with **html** files or URLs, but it can also be used to import **javascript**, **css** or **svg**.

**Examples:**

```
[import_text_file file='/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/mapa-pagos-por-capacidad.html']

[import_text_url url='https://apps.greenpeace.es/data-vis/import/chart.html']
```
